5 different Indexes will be implemented. Index 2-5 are all expansions of Index1 and the previous index. The initial code for Index1 was given by our supervisors to start from. All other code has been written by us. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[] \textbf{Index1:} Creates a linked list of all words in the database. The search functions return a boolean value of the presence of the search string in the database.
    \item[] \textbf{Index2:} Creates a linked list of all words in the database alongside an article list of the titles where each word is present. The search function returns an article list of the titles the search appears in. 
    \item[] \textbf{Index3:} Creates a linked list of all the unique words in the database alongside an article list of the titles where each word is present. The search function return an article list of the titles the search appears in.
    \item[] \textbf{Index4:} Creates a hash table of a fixed size of all the unique words in the database alongside an article list of the titles where each word is present. The search function return an article list of the titles the search appears in.
    \item[] \textbf{Index5:} Creates a dynamic hash table of all the unique words in the database alongside an article list of the titles where each word is present. The search function return an article list of the titles the search appears in.
\end{enumerate}
