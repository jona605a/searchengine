\section{Methods for Benchmarking Boolean Search Indices}
To compare the indexing time, the code that indexed the different search engines were timed using Criterion. All search engines were indexed over different file sizes.

When comparing the search time, it was desired to measure the time over both varying file sizes and varying depths of queries, as this would showcase the advantages and disadvantages of some search engines. Therefore a variety of queries were generated. For each file size and for each chosen depth, 1000 queries were generated. To generate one query of depth $d$, $O(2^d)$ words and Boolean operators were found to fill in the Boolean query tree. With a $90\%$ chance a word that occurs in the file was selected. Otherwise, the string "icantbefound" was selected as that string is not present in any of the files. The Boolean operators were chosen uniformly at random. Thereby different queries were generated for each depth, but all queries were generated with the same seed, so the words and Boolean operators are selected in the same order.

For each file size and for each depth, searching for the 1000 queries was timed using Criterion.
