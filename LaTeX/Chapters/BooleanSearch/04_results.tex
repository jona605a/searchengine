\section{Results}
Search times over filesizes were times for queries of all depths ranging from depth 1 to depth 7. All these plots can be found in the appendix. Figure \ref{fig:Searchtimebool1} shows the search time for 1000 randomly generated queries of depth 1. For clarification, a depth of 1 means the act of either inverting one article list for a given word or using the AND or the OR operation on two article lists for two given words.

Figure\ref{fig:Searchtimebool7} shows the search time for 1000 randomly generated queries of depth 7.
