\section{Index7}
Index7 uses a hash map as its data structure, where the keys are the unique words of the database and the corresponding values are a list of articles where the word is present. 

Index7 stores the article lists as bit vectors. This means that every word has a list of bits, where bit $i$ corresponds to whether the word appears in article $i$ or not. For example, if the bit vector was 000...0101, the 1st and the 3rd bit are ones, which means the word appears in article 1 and 3. For databases with a low number of articles or when most words appear in most articles, this is very efficient as it only uses one bit per article-word occurrence. However, for a large database of articles it becomes inefficient, as it uses $\Theta(u\cdot a)$ space, where $u$ is the number of unique words and $a$ is the number of articles. 

In practice, a bit vector is an array of unsigned integers that are bit-encoded. Depending on the computer's architecture, this is either 32 or 64 bits per integer. So for example, in a database of 128 articles on a 64-bit computer, one would only need to store 2 numbers for every unique word, no matter how many articles it appears in. The first number represents the first 64 bits and the second number the next 64 bits. 
%To reduce verbosity, 64 bit architecture is assumed for the following examples.

The indexing is done by iteration through all articles. For each word in article $i$, the word's bit-wise article list will set the $i$th bit to 1 - representing that the word is present in this article. This uses constant time for each word, resulting in indexing taking $\Theta(n)$ time in total. 

\subsection{Search techniques for Index7}
Bit vectors are excellent for supporting Boolean operations, as computers are very fast at these. Performing an AND or OR operation between two bit vectors means performing the operation on each integer in the two arrays. Performing an INVERT operation on one bit vector means inverting each integer in the array. Since the length of a bit vector is $\lceil\frac{a}{64}\rceil = \Theta(a)$, these operations take $\Theta(a)$ time, although with small constants. 

This method of performing Boolean operations on the bit vectors of the index is used in evaluating the entire syntax tree. Using the example from figure \ref{fig:bool-st-example}, a search query could be "(Shoe OR Boot) AND (NOT Sandal)". The search goes through the syntax tree recursively, finds the bit vectors for all words and combines these using bitwise operations.

Correctness follows from how the bitwise operations AND, OR and INVERT exactly correspond to what the AND, OR and NOT search keywords should mean. The size of the tree is $O(q)$, where $q$ is the number of words in the query. At each node, either a word is looked up or a Boolean operation of AND, OR or NOT is performed. Looking up a word takes hashing time and the Boolean operations take $O(a)$ time, making the whole search take $O(a\cdot q)$ time.
