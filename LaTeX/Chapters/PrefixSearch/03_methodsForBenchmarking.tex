\section{Methods for Benchmarking Prefix search Indexes}
To compare the indexing time, the code that indexed the different search engines were timed using criterion. All search engines were indexed over different file sizes.

To compare the prefix search function against each other, 1000 prefixes were generated for each filesize. 1000 words were found for each filesize and the 3 first characters and an added "*" were then used as the prefix query. With a $90\%$ chance a word from the database of the file size was selected. Otherwise, a string not in the database was selected. 

For each file size, searching for the 1000 queries with complete words and the 1000 queries with prefixes were timed using Criterion.
