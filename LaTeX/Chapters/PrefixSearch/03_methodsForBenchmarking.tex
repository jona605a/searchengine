\section{Methods for Benchmarking Prefix search Indexes}
To compare the indexing time, the code that indexed the different search engines where timed using criterion. All search engines were indexed over different file sizes.

To compare the prefix search indexes to the previous indexes, the search time for complete single words where also times. Here 1000 words were found for each filesize. With a $90\%$ change a word from the database of the file size where selected. Otherwise, the string "icantbefound" where selected.

To compare the prefix search function against each other 1000 prefixes were found for each filesize. These were the same words used for finding a complete word but now only the first 3 characters. Insted of the "icantbefound" string the string ". *" where used as ". " cant be found in any of the tires.

For each file size, searching for the 1000 queries with complete words and the 1000 queries with prefixes were timed using Criterion.
