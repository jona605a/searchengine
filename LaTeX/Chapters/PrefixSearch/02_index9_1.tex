\section{Index9.1}\label{sec:index9.1}
Index9.1 is built using the same principles as Index9.0. Index9.1 differs by keeping tack of each nodes children by using a hashmap instead of a linked list. This affects the indexing time and the search time as follows:

Step 3-4 takes $O(1)$ time, as it now is a hashmap. The construction of Index9.1 thereby runs in $\Theta(n)$ time as all characters of the text need to be evaluated by step 3 or 4.

Searching for a single complete word in the index now takes $O(q)$ time and searching for a prefix now takes  $O(q + \$\cdot a)$ time.
