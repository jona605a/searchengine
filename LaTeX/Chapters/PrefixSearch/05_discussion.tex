\section{Disscussion}
When looking at \ref{fig:IndexingBoolPrefi} it is seen that all indexing times are linear in time complexity but with different constants. Index 9.0 and index 9.1 is slower than the Boolean indexes. This is expected as the indexing time of Index7 and Index8 only needs to process each word, whereas Index9.0 and Index9.1 process all characters in the text.

Index9.1 has the indexing time complex of $O(n)$ whereas index Index9.0 runs in $O(n\cdot \Sigma)$. Index9.0 is however indexing much faster than Index9.1 when looking at \ref{fig:IndexingBoolPrefi}. It is a well-known problem in RUST that hash maps may perform slowly. This is due to the complicated hash function designed to prevent hash table collision attacks \cite{FAQ}. the indexing time of Index9.1 thereby has great potential of improving by experimenting with simpler Hash functions such as RUST SipHash function or a funcktion de
